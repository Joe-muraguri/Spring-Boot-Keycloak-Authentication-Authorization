# Spring Boot Project with Keycloak Security Integration

## Overview

This Spring Boot project demonstrates integration with Keycloak for authentication, authorization, and user management. Keycloak is an open-source identity and access management solution that provides robust security features for modern applications.

## Features

- **Authentication:** Users can securely authenticate using Keycloak's authentication mechanisms, including username/password, social login, and multi-factor authentication.
- **Authorization:** Define fine-grained access control policies using Keycloak's role-based access control (RBAC) system.
- **User Management:** Utilize Keycloak's user management capabilities to manage user accounts, profiles, and permissions.

## Prerequisites

Before running this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 17
- Apache Maven
- Keycloak server (either self-hosted or using a cloud service)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Joe-muraguri/your_project.git
    ```

2. **Configure Keycloak:**

    - Set up a new realm in Keycloak.
    - Create clients, roles, and users as per your application requirements.
    - Make note of the Keycloak server URL, realm name, client ID, and client secret.

3. **Configure Spring Boot Application:**

    - Open `application.properties` file and provide the Keycloak server configuration:

    ```properties
    # Keycloak Configuration
    keycloak.realm=****Enter****your_realm_name
    keycloak.auth-server-url=****Enter****https://your-keycloak-domain/auth
    keycloak.resource=*****Enter*****your_client_id
    keycloak.credentials.secret=****Enter*****your_client_secret
    ```

4. **Build and Run:**

    ```bash
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```

5. **Access the Application:**

    Navigate to `http://localhost:8081` in your web browser. You will be redirected to the Keycloak login page. After successful authentication, you'll be granted access to the application.
